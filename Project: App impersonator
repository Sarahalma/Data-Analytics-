Think about your favorite apps, and pick one that stores your data- like a game that stores scores, an app that lets you post updates, etc. Now in this project, you're going to imagine that the app stores your data in a SQL database (which is pretty likely!), and write SQL statements that might look like their own SQL.

CREATE a table to store the data.
INSERT a few example rows in the table.
Use an UPDATE to emulate what happens when you edit data in the app.
Use a DELETE to emulate what happens when you delete data in the app.

/* What does the app's SQL look like? */
/* My Fitteness Pal*/

Create Table diary (id INTEGER, 
                   food TEXT, 
                   calories INTEGER, 
                   Excercise TEXT,
                   Excercise_minutes INTEGER,
                   calories_burned INTEGER);
INSERT INTO diary VALUES (1, 'egg sandwitch', 230, 'walking',30, 100);
INSERT INTO diary VALUES (2, 'fruit', 150, 'biking',20, 300);

INSERT INTO diary VALUES (3, 'steak', 500, 'hiking',40, 400);

INSERT INTO diary VALUES (4, 'beriany', 400, 'dancing',30, 150);

INSERT INTO diary VALUES (5, 'mac and cheese', 370, 'walking',60, 200);

INSERT INTO diary VALUES (6, 'fried chicken', 700, 'swimming',10, 300);

INSERT INTO diary VALUES (7, 'pizza', 650, 'dancing',15, 100);
SELECT * FROM diary;

UPDATE diary SET Excercise = 'jumbing'
WHERE id = 4;

SELECT * FROM diary;

DELETE FROM diary WHERE id = 7;

SELECT * FROM diary;
